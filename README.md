## FishHash
This is a work in progress version of Iron Fish's new mining algorithm FishHash. It was created by community member Lollidieb. It is a modified version of the [Ethash mining algorithm](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/mining-algorithms/ethash/) that uses the [blake3 hashing algorithm](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3) as well as some other customizations.

### Specification
Lollidieb has created a [specification](./FishHash.pdf) for the algorithm.

### Discussion
Discussion has been happening in the IronFish Discord [mining channel](https://discord.com/channels/771503434028941353/828803908067262484). There is also a [post](https://discourse.ironfish.network/t/proposal-memory-hard-mining-algorithm-fishhash/88) for the proposal on the IronFish Discourse website.
